/*takeaways
  - look at two rows at a time and see how many rectangles we can form
    1 0 [1] [1] [1]
    0 0 [1] [1] [1]
    - to form a rectangle you need two horizontal and two vertical lines
    - we scan two rows at a time only so only two horizontal lines to
      choose from
      nCr = n! / ((n â€“ r)! r!) => choose 2 (r) from 2 (2) only have one
      possibility = 1
    - we have 3 vertical lines to choose from so the number of combinations
      is:
      3C2 = 3!/(1! 2!) = 3
    - so total rectangles generated : 1 x 3 = 3
    - since we only look at two rows at a time so you can only have
      one horizontal combination.
      1 x nC2 = n!/((n-2)! 2!) = n(n-1)/2

  - so given two rows in the grid, we just have to calculate how many vertical
    lines can be formed by counting how many cols that have 1's on both rows
